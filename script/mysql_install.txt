Run Ruby, Gems, Rails, MySQL and RMagick on Cygwin
Before using cygwin, I did not expect that the commands of rails do not work in cygwin. To make ruby, gems and rails to work, there are some additional tasks to do as following:

        * Add devel -> make + ruby + gcc + subversion modules from cygwin installation
        * Download gems tgz install package from Ruby Gems download home
        * tar xzvf rubygems-1.0.x.tgz
        * cd rubygems-1.0.x
        * unset RUBYOPT (before install gems, clear RUBYOPT=rubygems)
        * ruby setup.rb
        * gem install rails --include-dependencies
        * Download mysql source tar.gz file from MySQL download page
        * tar xzvf mysql-5.0.45.tar.gz
        * cd mysql-5.0.45
        * ./configure
        * make install ( or to do it faster, just make install under sub directories libmysql and include.
        * gem install mysql
        * Change the database server from localhost to 127.0.0.1 in the database.yml of your rails app
        * Install ImageMagick, libmagick-devel, XFree86-lib-compat, xorg-x11-devel, libbz2-devel module from cygwin installation file
        * gem install RMagick
        * ruby script/server. voila!


bug:

mysql 5.4.0

checking for termcap functions library... configure: error: No curses/termcap library
libedit

make distclean
./configure --without-readline CFLAGS=-O2
